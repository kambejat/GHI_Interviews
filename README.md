# 🌍 Malawi District Graph Visualization

This is a D3.js-based interactive graph visualization of Malawi’s districts and their connections. The project includes:

- Force-directed graph layout
- Node click highlighting
- District search filter
- Responsive Tailwind CSS styling

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Force-Directed Graph**  
A physics-based simulation layout that positions connected nodes (districts) close together, while preventing overlap.

✅ **Interactive Node Selection**  
Click on a node (district) to highlight it in green (`#10b981`), toggling selection.

✅ **Search Bar**  
Filter nodes live as you type in the search box. Matching nodes are highlighted in amber (`#f59e0b`).

✅ **Responsive Styling**  
Tailwind CSS is used for a clean, responsive layout.
